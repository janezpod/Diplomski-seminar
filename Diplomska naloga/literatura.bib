  abstract = {A grammar can be regarded as a device that enumerates the sentences of a language. We study a sequence of restrictions that limit grammars first to Turing machines, then to two types of system from which a phrase structure description of the generated language can be drawn, and finally to finite state Markov sources (finite automata). These restrictions are shown to be increasingly heavy in the sense that the languages that can be generated by grammars meeting a given restriction constitute a proper subset of those that can be generated by grammars meeting the preceding restriction. Various formulations of phrase structure description are considered, and the source of their excess generative power over finite state sources is investigated in greater detail.}

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary
               This chapter discusses the several classes of sentence-generating devices that are closely related, in various ways, to the grammars of both natural languages and artificial languages of various kinds. By a language it simply mean a set of strings in some finite set V of symbols called the vocabulary of the language. By a grammar a set of rules that give a recursive enumeration of the strings belonging to the language. It can be said that the grammar generates these strings. The chapter discusses the aspect of the structural description of a sentence, namely, its subdivision into phrases belonging to various categories. A major concern of the general theory of natural languages is to define the class of possible strings; the class of possible grammars; the class of possible structural descriptions; a procedure for assigning structural descriptions to sentences, given a grammar; and to do all of this in such a way that the structural description assigned to a sentence by the grammar of a natural language will provide the basis for explaining how a speaker of this language would understand this sentence.}
